## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Input** — User types a message
2. **Preprocessing** — Text is tokenized, lowercased, stopwords removed, and lemmatized using NLTK
3. **Intent Matching** — Preprocessed tokens are matched against keyword patterns for each intent
4. **Response** — A random response from the matched intent is returned

## 🔧 Extending the Bot

To add a new topic, add a new intent to the `INTENTS` dictionary in `chatbot.py`:

```python
"your_topic": {
    "patterns": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "phrase to match"],
    "responses": [
        "Your response here!",
        "Another response variant!"
    ]
}
```
